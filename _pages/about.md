  **Time**: Dec 2024 ‚Äì Now (12h/week)

- **Optimization of OCR model in information extraction @Shanghai Fudan University** <br>
  Worked under Professor Wei Wang‚Äôs guidance on pollutant information extraction using OCR technologies. Conducted references review, designed scripts for text recognition and analysis, and prepared regular reports on model development and performance evaluation.  <br>
  **Time**: Jun ‚Äì Dec 2024 (15h/week)

- **COVID-19 Vaccine Reservation System** <br>
  *Terminal-based Vaccine Scheduler with Java and Azure SQL*  
  Designed and implemented a vaccine appointment scheduling system that allows users to create accounts, log in, check caregiver schedules, and reserve appointments through a terminal interface. Developed secure login with password hashing and salting, modeled patients and caregivers, and managed vaccine stock using SQL. Connected the system to a Microsoft Azure SQL database via JDBC.
